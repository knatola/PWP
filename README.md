# PWP SPRING 2021
Programmable web project spring 20201
# Coingecko extension

This project uses cryptocurrency data from https://www.coingecko.com/en/api and provides additional querying capabilities to the data. The API data is essentially "cached" to a relational db and updated periodically so this software provides slightly more stale price data, but gives more wide querying capabilities then using coingecko api.

Aim is to also provide "portfolio" creation + tracking capabilities of cryptocurency assets.
